Help for OFFER:

OFFER allows you to offer a list of vHosts to the users
of your network that they can accept at will without needing
an oper to set the vHost. The string $account in the offered
vHost will be replaced by a users' account name when they TAKE it.

If the !group parameter is provided, only users with the +v flag
in that group will be able to see it in OFFERLIST and TAKE it.

Syntax: OFFER [!group] <vHost>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& OFFER may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& OFFER mynetwork.users.$account
    /msg &nick& OFFER !atheme-users $account.users.atheme.net
