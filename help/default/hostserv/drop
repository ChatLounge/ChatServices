Help for DROP:

Permanently deactivates and removes your vhost.  After using
this command, your real hostname will be visible in /whois.
This action is irreversible, unless you ask network staff to
set it again or you REQUEST or TAKE another one.

You may use DROP at any time, but there may be a cooldown period
before you may have another one.

If you only want to turn it off temporarily, use the OFF command.

Syntax: DROP

    /msg &nick& DROP
