Help for RESTRICT:

RESTRICT allows operators to restrict what an account can and can not do.
It will currently block a user from grouping nicks, registering a channel,
requesting a vHost or taking an OFFERed vHost.

This is particularly useful if a user starts abusing these commands.

Syntax: RESTRICT <nickname> ON|OFF <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& RESTRICT game_boy ON Abusing vHost requests
    /msg &nick& RESTRICT nenolod OFF
