Help for ACC:

ACC returns parsable information about a user's
login status. Note that on many networks, /whois
shows similar information faster and more reliably.
ACC also returns the unique entity ID of the given account.
The answer is in the form <nick> [-> account] ACC <digit> <EID>,
where <digit> is one of the following:
    0 - account or user does not exist
    1 - account exists but user is not logged in
#if module nickserv/access
    2 - user is not logged in but recognized (see ACCESS)
#endif
    3 - user is logged in

If the account is omitted the user's nick is used and
the " -> account" portion of the reply is omitted.
Account * means the account the user is logged in with.

Syntax: ACC
Syntax: ACC <nick>
Syntax: ACC <nick> <account>
Syntax: ACC <nick> *

Example:
    /msg &nick& ACC jilles *
