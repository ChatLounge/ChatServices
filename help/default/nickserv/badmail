Help for BADMAIL:

BADMAIL allows you to maintain a list of email addresses that are
not allowed to be used to register accounts.

These email addresses are saved to the Atheme database and are kept
between services restarts.

In BADMAIL ADD, you are able to use glob matching to disallow email
addresses that match a pattern.

Syntax: BADMAIL ADD <email> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD jdhore1@gmail.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD *@aol.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD *@*.tk foo reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD some-spambot-pattern-*@gmail.com

BADMAIL DEL allows you to remove entries from the list of currently
banned email addresses.

Syntax: BADMAIL DEL <email>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL DEL foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL DEL *@aol.com

BADMAIL LIST allows you to list the currently banned email addresses.

Syntax: BADMAIL LIST

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL LIST
