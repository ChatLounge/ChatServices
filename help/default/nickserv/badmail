Help for BADMAIL:

BADMAIL allows you to maintain a list of e-mail addresses that are
not allowed to be used to register accounts.

These e-mail addresses are saved to the ChatServices database and
are kept between services restarts.

In BADMAIL ADD, you are able to use glob matching to disallow e-mail
addresses that match a pattern.

Syntax: BADMAIL ADD <e-mail> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD jdhore1@gmail.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD *@aol.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD *@*.tk foo reason
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL ADD some-spambot-pattern-*@gmail.com

BADMAIL DEL allows you to remove entries from the list of currently
banned e-mail addresses.

Syntax: BADMAIL DEL <email>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL DEL foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL DEL *@aol.com

BADMAIL LIST allows you to list the currently banned e-mail addresses.

Syntax: BADMAIL LIST [e-mail glob mask]

If an e-mail mask is specified, only bad e-mail addresses that match
the mask will be listed.  If no mask is specified, all bad e-mail

Examples:
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL LIST
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL LIST *@*.tk
    /msg &nick& BADMAIL LIST *@aol.com
