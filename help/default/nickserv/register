Help for REGISTER:

This will register your current nickname with &nick&.
This will allow you to assert some form of identity on
the network and to be added to access lists. Furthermore,
&nick& will warn users using your nick without
identifying and allow you to kill ghosts.
The password is a case-sensitive password that you make
up. Please write down or memorize your password! You
will need it later to change settings.
