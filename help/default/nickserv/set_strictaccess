Help for SET STRICTACCESS:

SET STRICTACCESS, if enabled, will mean it's only possible

hosts listed in the NickServ ACCESS list.  Do NOT enable
this feature unless you know what you are doing.

You may only enable this option from a connection that
matches at least one of the NickServ ACCESS list entries.

Syntax: SET STRICTACCESS ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET STRICTACCESS ON
    /msg &nick& SET STRICTACCESS OFF
