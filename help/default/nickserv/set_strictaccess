Help for SET STRICTACCESS:

SET STRICTACCESS, if enabled, will mean it's only possible
to identify/login to the account from connections from
hosts listed in the NickServ ACCESS list.  Do NOT enable
this feature unless you know what you are doing.

You may only enable this option from a connection that
matches at least one of the NickServ ACCESS list entries.

In the event you get locked out of your account as a result
of this option, you may use the RESETSTRICTACCESS command
to restore access.

Syntax: SET STRICTACCESS ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET STRICTACCESS ON
    /msg &nick& SET STRICTACCESS OFF
