Help for MARK:

MARK allows operators to attach notes to an account.
For example, an operator could mark the account of
a spammer so that others know the user has previously
been warned.

Syntax: MARK <nickname> ADD <note>

Adds a mark to a nick. Marks will be shown on doing
MARK <nick> LIST or using NickServ info.

Syntax: MARK <nickname> DEL <number>

Deletes the mark with the given number.

Syntax: MARK <nickname> LIST

Shows all marks for a nickname.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& MARK tomaw ADD Doesn't actually exist
    /msg &nick& MARK tomaw ADD You can add as many marks as you want
    /msg &nick& MARK tomaw LIST
    /msg &nick& MARK tomaw DEL 2
