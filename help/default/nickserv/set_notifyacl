Help for SET NOTIFYACL:

If enabled, get notified whenever your group or
channel access in channels where you're on the ACL
changes, or depending on channel or group settings,
whether other access entries in the channel or
group are changed.  This also includes being added
to new channels as well as being removed from
existing ones.

The notification will come in the form of a private
notice, as well as a memo, if possible.

Syntax: SET NOTIFYACL [ON|OFF]

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET NOTIFYACL ON
