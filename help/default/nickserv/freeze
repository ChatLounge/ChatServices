Help for FREEZE:

FREEZE allows operators to "freeze" an abusive user's
account. This logs out all sessions logged in to the
account and prevents further logins. Thus, users
cannot obtain the access associated with the account.

FREEZE information will be displayed in INFO output.

Syntax: FREEZE <nick> ON|OFF <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FREEZE pfish ON Persistent spammer
    /msg &nick& FREEZE alambert OFF
