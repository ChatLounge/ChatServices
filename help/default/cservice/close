Help for CLOSE:

CLOSE prevents a channel from being used. Anyone
who enters is immediately kickbanned. The channel
cannot be dropped and foundership cannot be
transferred.

Enabling CLOSE will immediately kick all
users from the channel.

Use CLOSE OFF to reopen a channel. While closed,
channels will still expire.

Syntax: CLOSE <#channel> ON|OFF [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CLOSE #lamers ON spamming
    /msg &nick& CLOSE #spiderslair OFF
