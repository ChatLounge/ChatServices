Help for FORCEXOP:

FORCEXOP resets all channel access levels to
xOP compatible values. That is, after the
operation, the founder(s) will have all permissions
and autoop and everyone else on with flags
will be on one of the xOP lists. This command
is useful if the definitions for which flags
each xOP level gives change and the founder
wishes to use xOP commands only.

Only a founder can execute this command.
