Help for ACCESS LIST:

ACCESS LIST lists all users with channel access and their
roles in the channel. It uses fuzzy matching so if a user
does not exactly match any role, they will be listed as
the closest role they match.

Syntax: ACCESS <#channel> LIST

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ACCESS #atheme LIST
