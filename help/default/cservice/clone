Help for CLONE:

CLONE copies a channel's chanacs and metadata
to a new channel. Both channels must be registered
with &nick& and you must be founder in the target
channel for this command to work.

It will not copy the topic as most people will
want that different between the 2 channels.

It will also remove all chanacs (except founders)
and metadata of the same type from the target
channel.

Syntax: CLONE <#source-channel> <#target-channel>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CLONE #funstuff #morefun
