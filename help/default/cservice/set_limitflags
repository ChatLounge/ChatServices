Help for SET LIMITFLAGS:

SET LIMITFLAGS limits the power of the +f flag.

Users with +f that have neither +s nor +R
may only set +b (akick), and users that do not
have all of +s and +R may not set +s, +R and
+f.

Syntax: SET <#channel> LIMITFLAGS ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET #foo LIMITFLAGS ON
