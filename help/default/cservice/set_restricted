Help for SET RESTRICTED:

SET RESTRICTED designates a channel as restricted access.
Users who are not on the access list of the channel,
or who do not have the chan:joinstaffonly privilege
will be kicked and banned from the channel upon join,
removing any ban exceptions matching them first.
If the channel is set +i, no ban will be set
and invite exceptions will be removed.

Syntax: SET <#channel> RESTRICTED ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET #snoop RESTRICTED ON
