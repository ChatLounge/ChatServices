Help for RECOVER:

RECOVER allows you to regain control of your
channel in the event of a takeover.

Note: RECOVER may make the channel unusable by
general public!  If there is no takeover 
emergency, please read:

#if module chanserv/halfop
    /msg &nick& HELP HALFOP
#endif
    /msg &nick& HELP OP
#if module chanserv/protect
    /msg &nick& HELP PROTECT
#endif
#if module chanserv/owner
    /msg &nick& HELP OWNER
#endif

More precisely, in the case of RECOVER,
everyone will be deopped, limit and key will
be cleared, all bans matching you are removed, 
a ban exception matching you is added (in case
of bans ChatServices can't see), the channel
is set invite-only and moderated, and you are
invited.

If you are on channel, you will be opped and
no ban exception will be added.

Syntax: RECOVER <#channel>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RECOVER #foo
