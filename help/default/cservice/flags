Command provided by: chanserv/flags
#endif
Help for FLAGS:

The FLAGS command allows for the granting/removal of channel
privileges on a more specific, non-generalized level. It
supports nicknames, groups and hostmasks as targets.

When only the channel argument is given, a listing of
permissions granted to users will be displayed.

Syntax: FLAGS <#channel>

Otherwise, an access entry is modified. A modification may be
specified by a template name (changes the access to the
template) or a flags change (starts with + or -). See the
TEMPLATE help entry for more information about templates.

If you don't have +f you may still remove your own access
with -*.

#if !no_leveled_flags
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself, with the following exceptions:
    - Only founders may add/remove +R.
    - Only founders may add/remove +s.
    - To add/remove +f, you must have +s and/or be a founder.

These restrictions do not apply in the case of removing your
own access.
#else
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself.
#endif

#if permit_self_autoop
#if halfops
If you hold the flags +o, +h, and/or +v, you may add or remove
+O, +H, and/or +V on yourself regardless of whether you have
+f.
#else
If you hold the flags +o and/or +v, you may add or remove
+O and/or +V on yourself regardless of whether you have
+f.
#endif

#endif
#if !halfops
You may not edit users that have flags you don't have. For
this purpose, +v grants the ability to grant +V, +o grants
the ability to grant +O, and +r grants the ability to grant
+b.
#else
You may not edit users that have flags you don't have. For
this purpose, +v grants the ability to grant +V, +h grants
the ability to grant +H, +o grants the ability to grant +O,
and +r grants the ability to grant +b.
