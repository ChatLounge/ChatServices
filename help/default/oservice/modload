Help for MODLOAD:

MODLOAD loads one or more modules.

If the path does not start with a slash, it is taken
relative to PREFIX/modules or PREFIX/lib/atheme/modules
(depending on how Atheme was compiled). Specifying a
suffix like .so is optional.

If any of the modules need a rehash after being
loaded, this is done automatically.

Syntax: MODLOAD <path...>

Example:
    /msg &nick& MODLOAD ../contrib/fc_dice
