Help for MODUNLOAD:

MODUNLOAD unloads one or more modules. Not all modules
can be unloaded.

The names can be gathered from the MODLIST command. They
are not necessarily equal to the pathnames to load them
with MODLOAD.

Syntax: MODUNLOAD <name...>

Example:
    /msg &nick& MODUNLOAD chanserv/register
