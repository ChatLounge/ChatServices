Help for SQLINE:

SQLINE allows you to deny the use of certain nicknames
or channels network-wide.

A nickname sqline may contain *, ?, # (any digit) and
@ (any letter) wildcards. A channel sqline must be an
exact match, starting with # or &.

Syntax: SQLINE ADD <mask> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

If the !P token is specified the SQLINE will never expire (permanent).
If the !T token is specified expire time must follow, in minutes,
hours ("h"), days ("d") or weeks ("w").

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SQLINE ADD spambot* !T 7d bar reason
    /msg &nick& SQLINE ADD spam??? !P foo reason

The first example denies the use of nicknames starting with
"spambot" for 7 days.

The second example adds a permanent SQLINE on "spam???" for "foo reason."

Syntax: SQLINE DEL <mask|number>

If number is specified it correlates with the number on SQLINE LIST.
You may specify multiple numbers by separating with commas.
You may specify a range by using a colon.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SQLINE DEL foo
    /msg &nick& SQLINE DEL 5
    /msg &nick& SQLINE DEL 1,2,5,10
    /msg &nick& SQLINE DEL 1:5,7,9:11

Syntax: SQLINE LIST [FULL]

If FULL is specified the SQLINE reasons will be shown.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SQLINE LIST
    /msg &nick& SQLINE LIST FULL

Syntax: SQLINE SYNC

Sends all sqlines to all servers. This is useful because
sqlines must be present before the nickname or channel
is tried to be fully effective.
