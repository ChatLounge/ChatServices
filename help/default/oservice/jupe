JUPE introduces a fake server with the given name, so
that the real server cannot connect. Jupes only last
as long as services is connected to the uplink and
can also (on most ircds) be removed with a simple
/squit command.

Syntax: JUPE <server> <reason>

Example:
    /msg &nick& JUPE irc.blah.net very unstable server
