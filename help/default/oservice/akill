Help for AKILL:

AKILL allows you to maintain network-wide bans.
Services will keep your AKILLs stored and allow for easy management.

Syntax: AKILL ADD <nick|hostmask> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

If the !P token is specified the AKILL will never expire (permanent).
If the !T token is specified expire time must follow, in minutes,
hours ("h"), days ("d") or weeks ("w").

Examples:
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo !T 5 bar reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo !T 3d bar reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo@bar.com !P foo reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo@bar.com foo reason

The first example looks for the user with a nickname of "foo" and adds
a 5 minute AKILL for "bar reason."

The second example is similar but adds the AKILL for 3 days instead of
5 minutes.

The third example adds a permanent AKILL on foo@bar.com for "foo reason."

The fourth example adds a AKILL on foo@bar.com for the duration specified
in the configuration file for "foo reason."

#if !kline_do_not_remove_more_specific
If you add an AKILL that matches any existing AKILLs in the list, these
more specific AKILLs will be removed automatically.  For example, if the
AKILLs Skiddy@*.lamerz.net and *@poserz.lamerz.net are currently set,
adding an AKILL on *@*.lamerz.net will remove them, as the new AKILL will
match them both.  This only applies if the new AKILL is permanent, or if
it expires later than any of the matching entries.

Syntax: AKILL DEL <hostmask|number>

If number is specified it correlates with the number on AKILL LIST.

    /msg &nick& AKILL DEL foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& AKILL DEL 5
    /msg &nick& AKILL DEL 1,2,5,10
    /msg &nick& AKILL DEL 1:5,7,9:11

Syntax: AKILL LIST [FULL]

If FULL is specified the AKILL reasons will be shown.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& AKILL LIST
    /msg &nick& AKILL LIST FULL

Syntax: AKILL LIST <hostmask>

Shows any AKILLs matching the given hostmask, with reasons.

Syntax: AKILL LIST <number>

Shows the given AKILL, with reason.

Syntax: AKILL SYNC

services will be down or do not see a user as matching a
certain akill.
