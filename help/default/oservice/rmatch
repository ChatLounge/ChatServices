Help for RMATCH:

RMATCH shows all users whose
nick!user@host gecos
matches the given regular expression.

Instead of a slash, any character that
is not a letter, digit, whitespace or
backslash and does not occur in the pattern
can be used. An i after the pattern means
case insensitive matching.

By default, the pattern is a POSIX extended
regular expression. If PCRE support has been
compiled in, you can put a p after the pattern
to use it.

By default, there is a limit on the number
of matches. To override this limit, add
the FORCE keyword. In any case the actual
number of matches will be shown.

Syntax: RMATCH /<pattern>/[i][p] [FORCE]

Example:
    /msg &nick& RMATCH /^m(oo|00)cow/i FORCE
    /msg &nick& RMATCH #^[a-z]+!~?[a-z]+@#
    /msg &nick& RMATCH /^[^ ]* [^ ]*$/
    /msg &nick& RMATCH /\d\d\d/p
