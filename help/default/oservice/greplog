Help for GREPLOG:

GREPLOG searches through services logs and
displays matching lines.

The first parameter is either a service name
(to search all commands given to that service)
or an asterisk (to search all changes to services
data).

The second parameter is the pattern to search for.
It may contain * and ? wildcards and should usually
start and end in *.

The optional third parameter is the number of
previous days to search in addition to today.

Note that this command will only work if sufficient
information is written to log files.

Syntax: GREPLOG <service> <pattern> [days]
Syntax: GREPLOG * <pattern> [days]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GREPLOG ChanServ *#somechan* 7
    /msg &nick& GREPLOG * *#somechan* 60
