Help for SETPASS:

SETPASS allows you to set a new password
using a key emailed to you. The key is
valid for one time only, and also becomes
invalid if you identify with your old password.

To set a new password if you know the current
password, use SET PASSWORD instead of SETPASS.

Syntax: SETPASS <account> <key> <password>
