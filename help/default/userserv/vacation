Help for VACATION:

VACATION extends the expiration time for your
account (but not your channels) to three
times the usual value. You can only do this
if your account is registered long enough.

Vacation mode is disabled automatically the
next time you log in to &nick&.

Syntax: VACATION

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VACATION
