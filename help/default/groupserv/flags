Help for FLAGS:

The FLAGS command allows for the granting/removal of group
privileges on a more specific, non-generalized level. It
supports registered nicknames as targets.

When only the group argument is given, a listing of
permissions granted to users will be displayed.

Syntax: FLAGS <!group>

You can modify a users' flags if you yourself have the +f flag.
This has much the same syntax as chanserv/flags, using + to add
flags to a user and - to remove flags from a user.

Syntax: FLAGS <!group> [nickname flag_changes]

Permissions:
    +f - Enables modification of group access list.
    +F - Grants full founder access.
    +m - Read memos sent to the group.
    +c - Have channel access in channels where the group has sufficient
         privileges.
    +v - Take vhosts offered to the group through HostServ.
    +s - Ability to use &nick& SET commands on the group.
    +b - Ban a user from the group. The user will not be able to join the
         group with the JOIN command and it will not show up in their
         NickServ INFO or anywhere else. NOTE that setting this flag will NOT
         automatically remove the users' privileges (if applicable).
    +i - Grants the ability to invite users to the group.
    +A - View group access lists.

The special permission +* adds all permissions except +F.
The special permission -* removes all permissions including +F.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo +F
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo -*
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo +fmc
