ChatServices XMLRPC interface
-----------------------------

The modules/transport/xmlrpc/main module provides an XMLRPC interface to ChatServices.

ChatServices does not use HTTP authentication, instead using its own system with
authentication cookies.

All parameters are strings.

Methods from modules/transport/xmlrpc:

/*
 * atheme.login
 *
 * XML Inputs:
 *       account name, password, source ip (optional)
 *
 * XML Outputs:
 *       fault 1 - insufficient parameters
 *       fault 3 - account is not registered
 *       fault 5 - invalid username and password
 *       fault 6 - account is frozen
 *       default - success (authcookie)
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *       an authcookie ticket is created for the myuser_t.
 *       the user's lastlogin is updated
 */

Source ip is logged with the request, it does not need to be an IP address.

For web interfaces, the resulting authcookie can be stored in a HTTP cookie,
avoiding password storage.

The authcookie will be valid for one hour or until ChatServices shuts down.

/*
 * atheme.logout
 *
 * XML inputs:
 *       authcookie, and account name.
 *
 * XML outputs:
 *       fault 1 - insufficient parameters
 *       fault 3 - unknown user
 *       fault 5 - validation failed
 *       default - success message
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *       an authcookie ticket is destroyed.
 */

/*
 * atheme.command
 *
 * XML inputs:
 *       authcookie, account name, source ip, service name, command name,
 *       parameters.
 *
 * XML outputs:
 *       depends on command
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *       command is executed
 */

/*
 * atheme.privset
 *
 * XML inputs:
 * authcookie, account name, source ip
 *
 * XML outputs:
 * depends on command
 *
 * Side Effects:
 * command is executed
 */ 

Authcookie and account name specify authentication for the command; authcookie
can be specified as '.' to execute a command without a login.
Source ip is logged with the request, it does not need to be an IP address.
Service name is the nick of the service.
Command name is the command to be executed. Subcommand names are parameters.
Parameters are specified in the same order as on IRC with mostly one distinct
entity per parameter. Exceptions to this are for example operserv akill (two
parameters), operserv rwatch (one parameter) and nickserv set property (two
parameters in all cases).

Failed commands return an appropriate fault code with the first descriptive
string that would be returned on IRC. Most successful commands return all
descriptive text that would be returned on IRC; some, such as chanserv getkey,
return only a result string.

For experimenting with parameters and results you can use contrib/os_testcmd.
Usage is /os testcmd <servicename> <commandname> [parameters] where the
parameters are separated with semicolons.

For an example see contrib/perlxmlrpc.pl.

Other methods:

See the source code, modules/transport/xmlrpc/main.c.

Fault codes:

1 : fault_needmoreparams. Not enough parameters
2 : fault_badparams. Parameters invalid somehow
3 : fault_nosuch_source. Source account does not exist
4 : fault_nosuch_target. Target does not exist
5 : fault_authfail. Bad password or authcookie
6 : fault_noprivs. Permission denied (various, but not bad password/authcookie)
7 : fault_nosuch_key. Requested element on target does not exist
8 : fault_alreadyexists. Something conflicting already exists
9 : fault_toomany. Too many of something
10 : fault_emailfail. Sending email failed
11 : fault_notverified. Account not verified
12 : fault_nochange. Object is already in requested state
13 : fault_already_authed. Already logged in
14 : fault_unimplemented. Function not implemented

Negative fault codes are from the XMLRPC library, see also doc/XMLRPCLIB:
-1 : xmlrpc_process() was passed a NULL buffer
-2 : xmlrpc_parse() returned NULL, likely not a XML document
-3 : xmlrpc_method() returned NULL, likely XML document did not contain <methodname>
-4 : findXMLRPCCommand() returned NULL, able to find the method
-6 : method has no registered function
-7 : function returned XMLRPC_STOP
-8 : xmlrpc_set_buffer() was passed a NULL variable
